# DialogicTest

This is a quick project, to reproduce an issue in Godot using Dialogic 2.0 alpha11.

## How to reproduce

1. Use the arrow keys to move the sprite on the screen.
2. Press the interact button 'E' while the sprite is moving.

## Problem

There is a little freeze in the game before the bubble is displayed.
